Deploy this Quick Start to add secure self-service, data observability, and application deployment to your Amazon MSK environment. This Quick Start sets up Lenses.io in an Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC) and connects it to an AWS Managed Apache Kafka cluster. Lenses.io is a streaming data management service for Apache Kafka. It provides a data operations portal, giving you data observability and governance control for your real-time applications. Amazon MSK is a managed AWS service that helps you build and run Apache Kafka applications to process streaming data without needing to manage infrastructure. Your Kafka clusters run in an Amazon VPC managed by Amazon MSK, which continuously monitors server health and automatically replaces servers when they fail. The Quick Start deployment uses Amazon EBS for storage. Data stored on EBS is persisted in the case of instance failure or termination.
