This Quick Start deploys Lenses on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance connected to Amazon Managed Streaming Service for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). Lenses provides features for Kafka monitoring, governance, and self-service administration available over web, command line interface, and API endpoints. Amazon MSK helps you run Kafka data streaming applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud without managing infrastructure. Kafka clusters run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) and are managed by Amazon MSK. 

The Lenses Amazon EC2 instance is attached to an Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) volume for high availability, persistence, and data encryption. When you deploy the Quick Start, you can choose to enable Amazon CloudWatch logs to collect and track metrics on your Lenses instance.
