This Quick Start deploys Lenses.io on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance connected to Amazon Managed Streaming Service for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). Lenses.io provides monitoring, governance, and self-service administration of a Kafka environment. Amazon MSK helps you build and run Apache Kafka data streaming applications without managing infrastructure. Your Kafka clusters run in an Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC) managed by Amazon MSK, which continuously monitors server health and automatically replaces servers when they fail.    EBS, CloudWatch, AWS KMS???

By automatically configuring the included AWS services, this Quick Start helps you address streaming use cases such as:

* Capturing high volume application log files
* Analyzing website clickstreams
* Processing database event streams
* Tracking financial transactions
* Aggregating social media feeds
* Collecting IT log files
* Continuously delivering to a data lake
