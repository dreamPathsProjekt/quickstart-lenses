The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start deploys an Amazon EC2 instance to run Lenses.io and connects it to Amazon MSK. Lenses.io is a streaming data management service for Apache Kafka. It provides data observability, productivity, monitoring, security, and governance for Apache Kafka and event/streaming applications. Amazon MSK is a managed AWS service that helps you build and run Apache Kafka applications to process streaming data without needing to manage infrastructure. Your Kafka clusters run in an Amazon VPC managed by Amazon MSK, which continuously monitors server health and automatically replaces servers when they fail. 

By automatically configuring the included AWS services, this Quick Start helps you address real-time streaming use cases, for example:

* Capture high volume application log files
* Analyze website clickstreams
* Process database event streams
* Track financial transactions
* Aggregate social media feeds
* Collect IT log files
* Continuously deliver to a data lake
