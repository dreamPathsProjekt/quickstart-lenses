This Quick Start deploys Lenses on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance connected to Amazon Managed Streaming Service for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). Lenses is an application and data operations workspace for Apache Kafka. It provides a web interface and features for secure self-service, data observability, and monitoring of Kafka topologies. Amazon MSK helps you build and run applications that use Kafka on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud without managing infrastructure. Amazon MSK manages Kafka clusters running in a virtual private cloud (VPC) for high availability and failover support. 

The Lenses Amazon EC2 instance is attached to an Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) volume for high availability, persistence, and data encryption. When you deploy the Quick Start, you can choose to enable Amazon CloudWatch logs to collect and track https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html[metrics] on your Lenses EC2 instance.
