Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) manages your Apache Kafka infrastructure so you can pivot from administration to building streaming applications. Lenses adds a DataOps layer to Kafka with features for developer self-service, data observability, and monitoring. This Quick Start combines the security and infrastructure management of Amazon MSK with the full-service visibility of a Lenses web interface.

Lenses launches in a security group on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. Developers access the Lenses dashboard to view and control data and applications running in the Amazon MSK Kafka infrastructure. In Lenses, they can set up cluster monitoring to receive alerts in Amazon CloudWatch when incidents occur such as offline or under-replicated partitions. Lenses offers broad access to partitions, topics, and data flows, and the ability to query data with Structured Query Language (SQL).
