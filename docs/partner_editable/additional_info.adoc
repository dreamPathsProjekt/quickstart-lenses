The EC2 instance deployed by this Quick Start supports Amazon EC2 Instance Connect. With EC2 Instance Connect, you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and principals to control SSH (Secure Shell) access to your instances, removing the need to share and manage SSH keys. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Connect-using-EC2-Instance-Connect.html[Connect to your Linux instance using EC2 Instance Connect^].
